OpenMeetings Desktop Sharing Protocol ODSP is quite similar to RTP but it has a few extensions to transfer META-DATA and to do the Signaling.

It is designed to be extensible with other codecs and implementations.

More info on what the Packets look like will follow.
OpenMeetings has Decoders and Encoders for this Protocol since [r2320](https://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/source/detail?r=2320)
