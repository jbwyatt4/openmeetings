# Cameras #

We recommend the following cameras:

  * Logitech QuickCam Sphere AF
  * Logitech QuickCam E3500
  * Samsung Pleomax PWC-7100
  * Genius Look320S
  * Integrated Lenovo 3000 n100
  * Skypemate WC-103M

# Headsets #

The recommended headset model (i.e. headphones with microphone) is:

  * Logitech Clear Chat Style

Also the following headsets showed good results:

  * ClearChat PC Wireless (helps to suppress echo)
  * Logitech USB Desktop Microphone - Mikrophon (good sound, but bad echo cancellation)

**Note for Mac OS X users:** The build-in microphone normally has quite good quality and echo cancellation, so Mac OS X users often do not even require a headset.

# Speakerphones #

When several people participate from the same location, we recommend using the following speakerphone models:

  * Phoenix Audio Quattro2 USB Speakerphone MT301 (a single microphone + speakers can be used even with 20-30 people sitting in a room)
  * Phoenix DUET Executive
  * Jabra SPEAK410
  * Plantronics MCD 100M
  * Konftel 300
