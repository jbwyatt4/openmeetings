# Contribute to SVN #

Information how to add and edit code in Branches and Trunk.

  * If you make deeper modifications work in a separate branch
  * All Issues and work should be mentioned in the Issue tracker
  * If you merge a code to trunk ping the Developer-List about it
  * If you work on any Issue in the Issue tracker change the Status of the Issue to **Started**
  * if you finished an Issue change the Status to Fixed OR change it to Review and give it to the Review Person. In case of doubts give it to Sebastian for reviewing.
  * Issues which are fixed should have a revision-Number in the comment, to see at which revision you have fixed it finally.
  * code should fit into the CodingGuidelines

# Creating Patches #

If you have no SVN-Access but would like to participate, you can create a Patch and send it to the developer-mailing-list or add it to the Issue tracker.

There are two Repo's available, one for the Webapp and one for the Client. These are two projects.
  * Project A:
> http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/client/
  * Project B:
> http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webapp/

Please do create a Patch for _each_ Project separated. So if your patch only concerns the Client side, please make a patch, where
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/client/
is the root of your project.
