#summary Integration into Sakai

In 2010, [http://www.samoo.es Samoo company] has developed a plugin that integrates Sakai LMS and OpenMeetings.

The plugin was developed for some Spanish Universities that use Sakai and belongs to [https://confluence.sakaiproject.org/display/SPANISH/S2G+-+Spanish+Sakai+Group "Spanish Sakai Universities"] group:

   * [http://www.udl.es/ Universitat de Lleida ]
   * [http://www.upv.es/ Universidad Politécnica de Valencia ]
   * [http://www.um.es/ Universidad de Murcia]
   * [http://www.unavarra.es/ Universidad Pública de Navarra]
   * [http://www.ucam.edu/ Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia]

The plugin contains the following features:
   * Create videoconference rooms through Sakai:
      # Integrated with calendar
      # Integrated with announcements
      # Sends an email to all site participants
      # Rooms restricted to site groups
      # Configurable room type

   * Future requirements
      # Publish room recordings to students
      # Room reservation

We need the authorization of Spanish Universities to release the code but you can test the integration in Samoo demo [server http://demo.samoo.es]
