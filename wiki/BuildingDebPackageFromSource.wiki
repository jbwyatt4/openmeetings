 Openmeetings can now be easily packaged as Debian .deb package for further installation on many popular linuxes

= Building sources =

At first, you need to build your code distribution as described in the following [http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/wiki/BuildSourceNew article]


= Checking out the package directory structure =

The package directory structure can be obtained from SVN using the following URL: https://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/debian_package

After checkout, sources distribution should be placed into *<debian package folder>*/usr/share/red5-openmeetings folder

Please, make sure you chmod *<debian package folder>* to root:root to avoid any possible errors.

= Building the debian package =

After you have modified all the scripts to your current needs and placed source distribution into the appropriate folder, you need to update the DEBIAN/md5sums file accordingly. Typically this is done by switching to *<debian package folder>* and running the following command as a root:
`find . -type f ! -regex '.*DEBIAN/.*' -printf '%P\0' | xargs -r0 md5sum > DEBIAN/md5sums`
Then `cd ..` and build package using `sudo dpkg -b `*<debian package folder>* *<debian package name>*, where name typically is red5-openmeetings_1.0.XXXX.noarch.deb, where XXXX is the build number. Voila, you are ready to distribute your own debian package.
