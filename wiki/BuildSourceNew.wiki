#summary Building Source and develop

= Run, Develop, Test, Debug all in Eclipse =

To develop or build !OpenMeetings you download the Project as regular Web-Project.
You need the Subclipse Plugin for Eclipse, a database and a Tomcat Server installed on your system to test and debug the Code.

== Step1 - Get required Software ==

To develop !OpenMeetings you need at least:
  * Eclipse in a up to date copy and Java6
  * Subclipse Plugin (to download the Code from the Repository into Eclipse)
  * MySQL (or Postgres, or other Databases supported by Hibernate)
  * Tomcat 6 installed on your system to test and debug the code

== Step2 - Download the Source ==

Advanced Users:
Check out the Code from the Repository as a Dynamic Web-Project into Eclipse.

URL: http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/singlewebapp/

Add Memory settings to Run Configuration (Run > Run Configurations ...)
Click on Apache Tomcat > Your Server Name 
Second Tab > Arguments 
Add:  -Xms512m -Xmx1024M add the end

=> the webapp will install itself into Context Root.
URL to run is: http://localhost:8080/openmeetings/maindebug.lzx?lzproxied=solo

Step-By-Step:

1) Start Eclipse

2) Change Perspective to SVN Repository Exploring:<br/>

== Step3 - Build and deploy the code in Eclipse ==

Add Tomcat Server in Eclipse and deploy !OpenMeetings webapp into it

1) Open the Dialog View *Server* in Eclipse and right click inside, choose ADD > New from the context menu<br/>

2) In the upcoming Dialog choose Tomcat 6 as server <br/>

3) Click on the button next to *Choose Tomcat Install Directory* and point to your local Tomcat Installation dir<br/>

4) Make sure that the Tomcat server does use Java6 as Runtime environment <br/>

5) Add !OpenMeetings webapp which is called ROOT (select the webapp and click ADD)<br/>

6) Click Finish<br/>
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/docs/buildFromSource/deploy_6.png

7) You will see a new Entry in the Server's Dialog of Eclipse including your webapp, right click on it and choose *Publish* <br/>

8) Goto the Package Explorer, WebContent/conf/hibernate.cfg.xml and enter the correct values for user/auth/database <br/>

9) Right click on the Server and *start* <br/>
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/docs/buildFromSource/deploy_9.png

10) Choose Run > Run Configurations ... from the Eclipse Main Menu and navigate in the Dialog to your new Tomcat Installation like in the Screen. Then goto the Tab Arguments and increase the allowed memory by adding  -Xms512m -Xmx1024M at the end of the arguments. Hit Apply and (re)start tomcat.<br/>

11) You can then navigate to the URL in the browser:<br/>

== How to create .war ==

  * Run the ant - task
  * Export in Eclipse a .war file

Note: The Project is called ROOT. You can only have ONE Root project by Application Server. We need to to that as its required for supporting RTMPT in RED5.
So the !OpenMeetings will automatically become your Context Root in Tomcat (or whatever Java Application Server)

== Tipps and Gotchas ==

  * When you run and test !OpenMeetings inside Eclipse, Eclipse may be not able to do conversion using *convert* or *pdf2swf*, cause it has another system_path variables set. You should goto the Administration>Configuration section of !OpenMeetings and set the absolute Path to Image-Magick and SWFTools and it will work again. Uploading of PDFs might fail because of the same reason => the path to Ghostscript cannot be read from the system_path. Unfortunately you cannot overwrite that in the Configuration as its an internal link of Ghostscript. However in production environment you will not run into this Issue, its a development problem.
