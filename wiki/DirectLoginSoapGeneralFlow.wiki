#summary General Flow of Direct-Login/Managing Rooms with SOAP-Gateway
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

_This Feature will is available since Version 0.5.1_

== Summary ==

The trick about the !DirectLogin-Flow (SSO) is that you can go into a room directly without having any !OpenMeetings account. You always use the same (Admin!!) user to login via the Web-Service and then use the !setUserObjectAndGenerateRoomHash method to set custom user-value to a specific session. The Method !setUserObjectAndGenerateRoomHash returns a HASH, you add this HASH as param in the URL and thats it.

== Recommended Scenario ==

You would like that people can create a conference room via your Application and return to that room several times. You only need to store the room-Id in your application logic, and the authentication data if the !OpenMeetings admin user to manage the SOAP connection.

If a user wants to directly login into that room he does that in two basic steps (Phase 2 and Phase 3 in the Graph):
  # Sets the User session (getSession, loginUser, setUserObjectAndGenerateRoomHash)
  # Login into the Room, by adding the HASH from setUserObjectAndGenerateRoomHash to the URL

The HASH of setUserObjectAndGenerateRoomHash is only one time valid! For security reasons, otherwise people could take that link and send it by email and so flood the system with not-authorized access.
  
If the Room needs password protection, then this must be implemented in the Application-Logic while managing the Room (Application Logic of the environment). Also this environment has to take care that the room will be deleted if it is not needed anymore.

URL for direct Room access: (secureHash=6c280410c96e91ea05d25e0b28b10a87 MUST be replaced with a valid HASH you create using the SOAP Gateway Method setUserObjectAndGenerateRoomHash)

Important Note:
Starting with OpenMeetings 1.1 you should use the Link like this:
http://$YOUR_RED5_HOST:$YOUR_RED5_HTTP_PORT/openmeetings/?secureHash=6c280410c96e91ea05d25e0b28b10a87
(there is no typo here!! openmeetings/?param=value => that is the format of the URL!)

Older Versions of !OpenMeetings:
http://$YOUR_RED5_HOST:$YOUR_RED5_HTTP_PORT/openmeetings/main.swf8.swf?secureHash=6c280410c96e91ea05d25e0b28b10a87&language=4&lzproxied=solo
or

(if the language_id is missing it will use the default_language_id from the configuration section)

== How to set up a user as default Moderator in a Room ==

You may want that the Role from your system is transfered to !OpenMeetings, so that for example in a ELearning application a teacher automatically is an Moderator.
To force normal Users to wait in a room until the moderator has arrived you need to create the room via the method addRoomWithModeration and set the param *isModeratedRoom* to true.
To generate a HASH for a User that then automatically is Moderator you set the param *becomeModeratorAsInt* to 1 in the Method setUserObjectAndGenerateRoomHash
