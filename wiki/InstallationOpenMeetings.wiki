== Hidden and experimental features ==

  * SSL encryption, search the mailing list for "native SSL".
  * if you resize your own video-pod in the conference much larger and then synchronize  the stream, all clients will get a better picture (it also needs more bandwidth, as it will take the actual new height / width numbers to publish your stream)
  * there are some hidden emoticons (for example (activate)), you might want to add your own ones [http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webapp/webapp/openmeetings/public/emoticons/emotes.xml Full List]

== Integration, Single Sign On and LDAP ==

  * Regarding LDAP-Configuration see the Installer Script and sample Configuration 
  * [ActiveDirectoryLDAP  Configure LDAP Authentication with Active Directory]

== using 3th Party Publishing Software, RTP-Streams or IP-Cams ==

  * If you want to integrate 3th Party Software for publishing Live-Video you may have a look at [http://www.xuggle.com Xuggler]. There is no out of the Box solution but there are already people successfully publish their usual [http://www.red5wiki.com/wiki/SteamStream RTP-LiveStream] by using Xuggler

== Tips and Tricks ==

  * Use the Debug-Application: Enter in your browser http://$RED-HOST:$RED5-PORT/openmeetings/maindebug.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf for example http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/maindebug.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf
  * If you have Problems with conversion-jobs check your Red5-Log output. There will be error Messages which help you. You must install !OpenOffice, !ImageMagick, !GhostScript and SWFTools to run all conversion-Jobs correctly.
  * if you have problems in converting Files check the Batch-Scripts in $OPENMEETINGS_HOME/jod
  * If you want to use red5 as a service (without red5.bat), you need to move red5\wrapper\wrapper.exe to red5\wrapper.exe. Then change some path in conf\wrapper.conf (like ..\lib\foo.jar to lib\foo.jar). And finally change the register key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Red5\ImagePath to point to the new wrapper.
  * you can query a Mysql Database to get the schema_collection by using this query: 
{{{
SELECT Table_name, TABLE_COLLATION FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'openmeetings' ORDER BY table_name DESC
}}}
