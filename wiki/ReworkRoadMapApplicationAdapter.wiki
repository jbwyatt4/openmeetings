#summary This should summarize the Rework of the ApplicationAdapter

== Version 0.6 ==

 * new !ApplicationAdapter Class (keep old one, add new one and change red5-config)
 * reconnect Users to each Scope instead of general Scope when they enter a room. So you only need to iterate through the Users of a Room instead of all Users (BIg workload in this Issue! maybe this can be split up into severals) => this also includes a rework of the !RoomClient-List (Issue 589, Issue 364)
 * add some sort of graph that illustrates the event-model of the room-enter and room-leave events => this is important to have better control and overview of the logic of the !RoomClients! to prevent Zombies and other issues (Issue 592)
 * fix Zombie-Control Run (Zombies can be duplicated by VPN connections on OSx for example)
 * fix recorder (move recorded FLV to default scope so that record does not have to connect to each scope, only to default one (Issue 583)
 * fix overall chat to be able to send message in every scope
 * fix screen sharing to add the scope-name to be able to send the Screen to the custom room-name

== Version 0.7 ==

 * add overview in Administration which user is in which room
 * add option in Administration to kick users out of room (Issue 291)
 * enable to configure each room another domain to enable a multi server scenario (some kind of clustering where one server is central and redirects each user to the correct room)

== Version 0.8 ==
