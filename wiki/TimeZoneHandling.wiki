#summary OpenMeetings and timezone handling

List of default Timezones:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/singlewebapp/WebContent/languages/timezones.xml

To add a new Time Zone you have to lookup its represant in the Timezone registry.
You can then add freely new time zones.

The Servers default time zone is stored in the configuration table in the attribute *default.timezone*. The name in this value links to an attribute in the table om_timezone in the column *jname*.

You can set a Flag *forceTimeZoneCheck* for each user that gives him a Pop-Up notification to change his time zone. The Flag can be changed in the user administration of !OpenMeetings. This can be handy if you update from a previous version of !OpenMeetings to make sure users see the new feature and update their settings.
