#summary How To Build From Sources
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

= Source Locations Developer Version =

You need to compile two apps:
  * Client - build with !OpenLaszlo
  * Webapp - Java-Webapp

= Openlaszlo Client (Client-Side) =

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/

for compiling the client you need to install the !OpenLaszlo-Server:
http://www.openlaszlo.org

place the content of 
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/xmlcrm/videoconference/

Step-By-Step:
  * Download and Install !OpenLaszlo 4.0.7 (Version > 4.0.5 is needed!)
  * Checkout from the SVN using http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/ as root of your Project ($CLIENT_SOURCE_ROOT)
  * Copy the directory videoconference of $CLIENT_SOURCE_ROOT/xmlcrm/ into your Openlaszlo -WebRoot ($LPS-HOME/Server/lps-4.0.7/) ... on Windows your Path if you're using the default one's will look like C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 4.0.5/Server/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/... 
  * alter the config.xml in videoconference/config.xml (for example C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 4.0.5/Server/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/config.xml) ... _rtmphostlocal should match the IP/domain of your red5-streaming server (if its on the same IP like your Openlaszlo-Server you can leave it blank)
  * Start OpenLaszlo Server and run: http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.0.7/videoconference/maindebug.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo and http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.0.7/videoconference/main.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo

= Java Webapp (Server-Side) =

  * Download (SVN - Checkout) from:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/
  * change dir your local copy
  * Run: ant dist (JAVA_HOME must be set and point to a JDK)

there is now a directory dist, inside of that directory there is a compiled red5-webapp.
You have to copy the Laszlo-Client from the Step-By-Step scenario into it.

Notes on building sources;

If you see error fields on login form it means you didnt run Install yet and necessary fields in Db is NOT yet populated.

Basic steps; After checkout fresh copy from svn repo (windows users look for tortoise svn, linux users already knows what to do, hehe), 
  # set JAVA_HOME to jdk 1.5 or greater,
  # run ant dist at where build.xml located, 
  # copy xmlcrm dir which is inside of dist to red5 server webapps dir, 
  # change config.xml and install/hibernate.cfg.xml to wanted db connection, (dont forget to run mysql or any db at this moment) 
  # copy main.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf and maindebug.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf to red5 webapps dir, 
  # run http://localhost:5080/xmlcrm/Install (not install case sensitive) 
  # watch populated fields from red5 console, it takes a time, grab o coffee :) 
  # Finally run http://localhost:5080/xmlcrm All paths relative, be carefull.

Final note: Every little change effects immediately when you refresh browser window while you work with Laszlo. And comment is <!-- --> lines Hope it helps some one, Happy coding

Command-Line Access

If you plan to make changes, use this command to check out the code as yourself using HTTPS:

# Project members authenticate over HTTPS to allow committing changes.
svn checkout https://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ xmlcrm --username $!Your_Google_Account

When prompted, enter your generated googlecode.com password.

Use this command to anonymously check out the latest project source code:

# Non-members may check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP.

GUI and IDE Access

This project's Subversion repository may be accessed using many different client programs and plug-ins. See your client's documentation for more information.
