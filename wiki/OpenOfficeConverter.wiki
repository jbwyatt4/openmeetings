Install OpenOffice from the OpenOffice side
Normally it is installed into your Application folder.
Goto file:
/Applications/OpenOffice.org\ 2.0.app/Contents/MacOS/share/registry/data/org/openoffice/Setup.xpu

add the following after the node *<node oor:name="Office">                                                                                                                                                   *:

                </prop>  
}}}

start x11/x-server (you can just start openoffice the normal way, close the openoffice app again but do NOT close the x-server/x-terminal, it will open a display for x11 on display :0)

open a new terminal and type:
sudo /Applications/OpenOffice.org\ 2.0.app/Contents/MacOS/program/soffice -display :0 -headless -nologo -norestore
