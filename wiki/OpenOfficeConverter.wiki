start x11/x-server (you can just start openoffice the normal way, close the openoffice app again but do NOT close the x-server/x-terminal, it will open a display for x11 on display :0)

open a new terminal and type:

sudo /Applications/OpenOffice.org\ 2.0.app/Contents/MacOS/program/soffice -display :0 -headless -nologo -norestore

OR

/Applications/OpenOffice.org\ 2.0.app/Contents/MacOS/program/soffice -display :0 -headless -nologo -norestore

sudo depends of your Red5 service .. if red5 is started as sudo (which must be started as sudo if the server is listening on port 80 (or smaller 1200) then ooservice also has to run as sudo cause it writes/reads from directories which red5 creates.

= Windows =
  * Install Open Office
  * Launch it one time (sothat you have filled the registrering form of Open Office which does only popup one time)
  * Open a Command-Prompt (CMD) and goto your Open Office Executable directory (for example ,,C:\Programme\OpenOffice.org 2.0\program,,)
  * Run Open Office in headless Modus with this command:
  ,,soffice.exe -headless -nologo -norestore -accept=socket,host=localhost,port=8100;urp;StarOffice.ServiceManager,,
  * check if its running by typing: ,,netstat -anp tcp,,
  you should find a line: 
    ,,TCP    127.0.0.1:8100         0.0.0.0:0              ABHÖREN,,
