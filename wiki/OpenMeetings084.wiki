#summary Release Notes of OpenMeetings 0.8.4 and Moodle Mod 0.5

Release 0.8.4 basically adds some new SOAP Functions for directly entering and editing a Room. Some Room-Attributes have been removed that concern the Layout of a Room. However yu may still use the previous SOAP Calls but it is recommended to Update to use the latest API-Calls see [SoapMethods].

The Moodle Plugin enables you now to use more feature of OpenMeetings:
  * Create both Room Types Conference Room (Multiple Videos) and Event Room (Single Bigger Video)
  * Set an individual Room Language and Max Number of Participant per Room
  * Set a Flag for a Room so that Students and Guests have to wait and will NOT become the Moderation Role in a Conference Room by default, they will have to wait untill a Moodle-Teacher, -Admin or -Creating-Teacher comes and enters a Room.

We would like to thank all Contributors, User, Developers of OpenMeetings and [http://www.openkvarken.fi/ Open Kvarken] for supporting us.
