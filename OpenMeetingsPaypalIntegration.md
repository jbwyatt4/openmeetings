## License Options (Pay-per-Minute or Volume Flatrate) ##

The user can buy either minutes and every time he enters a conference room a counter will start and his profile will be updated.
It is not possible to cheat by accessing a Room with the same account at the same time.

Sending Invitations or creating Scheduled Meetings via the Calendar is not possible for Pay-per-Minute Users. Otherwise those Users could send them self a invitation and in that way get unlimited access to meeting rooms.

The other option for user is to buy a Volume-Flatrate. Either 3 or 6 months unlimited access to the system. Users with Volume-Flatrate can also send Invitations and create meetings via the calendar.

## Payment Options (Paypal with Credit Card or Direct Debit) ##

As soon as the user clicks **Checkout with Paypal** he is processed to Paypal's Website. Depending on his country he has different payment options. All countries have the major Credit Cards. For example on openmeetings.de => Users from Germany can also pay by direct debit, as the Paypal account on openmeetings.de is in German.

The whole payment process is multi-language.

## Invoice and Transaction Status ##

The user will receive an Email as soon as the Payment is received on the Paypal account.
That usually takes only 30-60 seconds.
The email to the buying user contains also the Invoice. There are different Invoices generated based on the country of the user.

There is also a list of past and present transactions and the possibility to download invoices of past transactions in the user profile.
