_outdated - WML Files are not in this format stored anymore_

# Summary #

You can store and load files in the whiteboard. These files will be stored with the extension **.wml** on the file-system (owned by the owner of the Java-Process)

wml is not the same like Wiki-Markup-Language. But it would be nice if in future release wml pages could be used into the app. For the moment it is just a customized xml format. And could be called: Whiteboard-Markup-Language

You can see an example here:
