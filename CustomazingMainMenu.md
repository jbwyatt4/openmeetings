To customize the main menu (for example remove entries or changing the order) you can edit the tables:
  * navimain
  * naviglobal
  * navisub (currently not in use)

You need to make sure that you **restart red5 after doing changes to the database**, there is a database cache, so changes might not take affect as long as you did not restart.
