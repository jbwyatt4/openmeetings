as you can see here in the first screen you see both toolbars at default position.
In the second screen I dragged the Paint-Panel from the side to the middle.
In the third screen you can see how the Paint-Panel **plugs** against the border of the Whiteboard.

The Property Panel on bottom can be closed or opened and display Object details.
You can edit the Properties x,y,widht,height in the Property Panel of by draging the Object.
In a later stage you can also edit the Property of Object specific details like Color of a Rectangle, Fontsize of a Letter/Word-Object, et cetera.
