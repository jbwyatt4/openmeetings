With the Backup panel you can:

  * Export your Userdate (Including Adresses, Emails, Organisation-Membership) to an XML-File
  * Import the File again
  * You can also only export users of a certain group

There Organisations must be already existing!
It will check if the login or Mail does already exist before Adding the Users
It will not generate Organisation, it will just add the Link between an User and an Organisation.
